Here’s a detailed **ToDo list as a project prompt based on your request**, focused on simplicity, speed, and using **Node.js + LangChain + Gemini (no third-party APIs)**:

---

## 🎯 **Project Prompt – Intelligent Loan Document Analyzer (Basic PoC)**

---

### ✅ **Objective**

Build a small backend application using **Node.js + LangChain with Gemini model integration** that allows:

1. Uploading a loan document (as a text file).
2. Extracting and displaying basic structured information from the document.
3. Enabling the user to ask questions about the document in natural language, and showing model-generated answers on screen.

---

### ✅ **High-Level Flow**

1. 📤 User uploads a loan document (text file).
2. 📝 Backend reads the file content.
3. ✍️ Use LangChain with Gemini to:

   * Extract key fields like:

     * Customer Name
     * Loan Amount
     * Loan Tenure
     * PAN/Aadhaar
     * Collateral Type
   * Show extracted data in a structured JSON format.
4. ❓ Allow the user to input custom questions about the document.

   * Example questions:

     * “What is the loan amount?”
     * “What is the customer’s PAN number?”
   * System passes the question + document text to LangChain + Gemini → Returns the answer.
5. ✅ Display the answer on the frontend screen.

---

### ✅ **Technical Constraints**

* 🚫 Do NOT integrate any third-party APIs other than LangChain + Gemini.
* ✅ Everything happens locally or via Gemini model + LangChain.
* 💾 Store the document temporarily in the server filesystem.

---

### ✅ **Basic Folder Structure**

```
loan-analyzer/
├── server.js           // Express backend
├── geminiService.js    // LangChain + Gemini integration
├── public/             // Simple HTML frontend for file upload + question input
├── uploads/            // Temporary file storage
├── package.json
├── .env                // Gemini API key (if required)
```

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step ToDo List**

---

#### 1️⃣ Set up Node.js + Express

* Initialize project with `npm init`.
* Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install express multer langchain dotenv
  ```

---

#### 2️⃣ Build File Upload API

* Use **multer** middleware to handle file uploads.
* Save uploaded file to `uploads/`.

---

#### 3️⃣ Read Uploaded Document

* Read the uploaded file content as plain text.

---

#### 4️⃣ Implement LangChain + Gemini Integration

* Create a basic service (`geminiService.js`) to:

  * Extract key fields from document.
  * Answer user’s custom questions.

* Example prompt for extraction:

  ```plaintext
  Extract the following fields from this document:
  - Customer Name
  - Loan Amount
  - PAN/Aadhaar
  - Loan Tenure
  - Collateral Type

  Document:
  {document_text}
  ```

* Example prompt for Q\&A:

  ```plaintext
  Given the following loan document, answer the question in detail:

  Document:
  {document_text}

  Question:
  {user_question}
  ```

---

#### 5️⃣ Simple Frontend (HTML + Vanilla JS)

* Upload file form → POST to file upload API.
* Show extracted JSON data in a `<pre>` block.
* Input field for custom question → POST to Q\&A API → Show response.

---

#### 6️⃣ Final Flow Example

1. Upload `loan_application.txt`.

2. System shows:

   ```json
   {
     "Customer Name": "John Doe",
     "Loan Amount": "₹5,00,000",
     "PAN": "ABCDE1234F",
     "Loan Tenure": "24 months",
     "Collateral": "Car"
   }
   ```

3. Ask: “What is the customer’s PAN number?” → Shows:
   `"ABCDE1234F"`

---

#### 7️⃣ No Third-Party Integration

* Only depend on LangChain + Gemini → No external APIs for KYC validation or database calls.

---

### ✅ **Why This is Useful**

* Simple PoC, easy to build and demo.
* Shows core strength of LangChain + Gemini in document understanding + question answering.
* Useful for internal loan process automation in the future.
